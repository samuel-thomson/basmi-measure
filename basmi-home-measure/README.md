# BASMI Home Measurement Application

The application consists of three pages accessible by tabs: the home, results and manual instructions pages, as well as the measuring page which is accessible from the main page.

The backend for this application is a FastAPI, which requires the `basmi-backend` directory and its files to run in a separate project.
This estimator is lifted from the development performed in _CV Analysis and Design_.
